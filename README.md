# STVKinectPhoto
SpacjaTV Photo booth project.

# Summary
Through this project it is possible to take pictures and save them by using the camera of a Kinect sensor. In order to make it work, the Kinect sensor has to be properly connected both to a Usb 3.0 port of the computer and to a power socket.

In order to use the program, only the code and a properly connected Kinect sensor are needed.

The final version of the project is contained in the "Kinect-final" zipped folder. Please use the .sln file from that folder.

When clicking the "Screenshot" button, the photo is automatically saved in the "Pictures" folder as a bitmap file.

# Built with
-Visual Studio
-Kinect SDK

# notes
In the separated branches are some developments of other functions that weren't successfully implemented (filtering images, sending pictures via mail)
